      Grilling the ribcage over medium-high heat creates a tantalizing aroma as the meat cooks to perfection, developing a charred exterior while retaining its juicy tenderness within.
      Throughout the cooking process, the marinade imparts a depth of flavor, enhancing the natural richness of the human rib meat.
